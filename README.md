# E-biofy-Techniche 2019

This event is an amalgamation of bio-statistics and relevant computational algorithms, namely machine learning, which aims to test budding students on their coding skills, as well as comprehending biological information.

##OVERVIEW:

Algorithms are to be evaluated for detection and classification of cancer affected regions. This task has high clinical relevance since early detection of anomalies and metastases in affected areas would reduce the workload of pathologists in both detection and diagnosis. 
 
The task in this challenge is to determine a pN-stage for every patient in the test dataset. To compose a pN-stage, the number of positive lymph nodes (i.e. nodes with a metastasis) are counted. There are two categories of lymph node metastasis:

Macro-metastases: metastases greater than 2.0 mm.

Micro-metastases: metastases greater than 0.2 mm or more than 200 cells, but smaller than 2.0 mm.

A separate category, called isolated tumour cells (ITC), is strictly not a metastasis, but is rather defined as: single tumour cells or a cluster of tumour cells smaller than 0.2 mm or less than 200 cells. Lymph nodes containing only ITC are therefore not counted as positive lymph nodes.
